## 📌 Instructions 

It's really easy to use, just click on the brick that you 
want in your level and it will be displayed as green. 

To remove it, click on the brick again. 

The UI can have some tweaks since i use a custom linux theme.
Feel free to address the source code if you have an icon missing
in your system. Enjoy.
